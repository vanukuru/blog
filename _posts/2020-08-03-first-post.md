The key to success in this exam is **Self Confidence!** or Faith in oneself. One acquires this through Focus, Sincerity and Smart HARDWORK!

In the last 10 years, what I have personally noticed is that, only 0.5% of the total students (across the country) who start their journey for this Examination either in their High School years or post their Class X, make their Dreams come true! That Dream being, Getting into an IIT! Yes, only 0.5%! who are Sincere to the core, Focussed and Hardworking, make this Happen.

This is because, only 0.5% of the students actually **convert their Dream into a Goal** when they enter their High School Years and some when they complete their Class X Board Examinations! A clear long term (2 to 4 years) goal. They make it their _Personal Goal_, not a Goal set for them, by their Parents, Friends, Cousins, Relatives. As it is their Personal Goal, set inside of them and by themselves (based on whatever rationale they considered for this), they go onto achieve the same. The remaining 99.5% do not make it as the Goal is set for them by someone outside of themselves. Hence, becomes Impossible to achieve.

Alert to all Parents out there (from a Parent myself), guide your children to set their Goals. Do not set the Goals for them or allow someone else to do this for them!
